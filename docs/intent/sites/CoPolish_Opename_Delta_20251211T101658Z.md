# CoPolish delta – Opename

UTS: 20251211T101658Z
Lane: CoSites / investor readiness

## 1. Snapshots from current site/index.html

- Detected <h1> (hero): $hero
- Detected <h2> (subhead): $subhead

These are for comparison only; no HTML has been changed by this DO.

## 2. Candidate investor one-liner (from CoSites_InvestorLines)

> Opename treats naming and framing as infrastructure, building conventions that work for humans and AIs instead of disposable branding.

Working notes:
- [ ] Decide how close the live hero should be to this investor line versus a more founder-facing tone.
- [ ] Check that any current tagline still matches how you talk about Opename in live conversations.

## 3. Quick polish checklist hook

From CoPolish_Checklist.md (Opename):

- [ ] Hero headline clearly says who this is for and why it exists.
- [ ] Tagline matches current pitch to investors and partners.
- [ ] No placeholder or obviously unfinished copy on the live home page.
- [ ] Footer has correct contact details (email, address, phone).

Use this delta file as a scratchpad while you walk through the checklist.

## 4. Suggested next micro-steps

- [ ] Capture desktop and mobile screenshots of the current home page for decks.
- [ ] Draft an updated hero + subhead pair that plays well with the investor one-liner.
- [ ] When a candidate is ready:
  - Create an index_next_<UTS>.html or branch in Git.
  - Log a short CoBus note before promoting to site/index.html.

This file is advisory only. It does not change the site; it gives Co1 and local stewards an anchored starting point for Opename polish.
